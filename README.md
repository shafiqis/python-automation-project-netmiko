Netmiko is a Python library designed to simplify network device management through SSH. It extends the functionality of Paramiko, a low-level SSH library, to offer a higher-level abstraction tailored specifically for interacting with network devices from various vendors.

With Netmiko, you can automate network tasks such as configuration management, command execution, and device monitoring across a wide range of devices, including routers, switches, firewalls, and more.
